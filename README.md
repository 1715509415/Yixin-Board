Yixin-Board
===========

Special-designed GUI for Yixin

  To run YiXin Board, you need GTK+ environment.
  
  For windows, I recommend gtk-2.16.0(http://downloads.sourceforge.net/gtk-win/gtk2-runtime-2.16.0-2009-03-22-ash.exe?download), because many other GTK+ runtime environments lost the file named "gspawn-win32-helper-console.exe" or report warning about fonts.
  
  For Linux and BSD, you are supposed to compile it by yourself.
  
  Features:
  
    (1)Written by GTK+ which is cross-platform, supporting Windows/Linux/BSD.
    
    (2)Open source code (New BSD license).
